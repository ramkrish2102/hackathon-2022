FBlocks (Using Blockchain to deliver better food supply chain)
The objective for this ide is to create and use blockchain technology which customers can use to scan quick response(QR) codes of food items from any food suppliers which includes meat, poultry, seafood, and vegetables. With the growth of food supply chain networks globally, cases of false reporting, fraud, and illegal production are on the rise. Without a thorough system to validate suppliersâ€™ information, consumers are in danger of consuming foods that may cause them harm. 
Blockchain is currently the only technology that promises a quick verification of valid and invalid information in the food chain. Food companies that are adopting blockchain have reported increased risk mitigation, leading to high food safety, consumer confidence, and higher sales. This idea aims to propose the integration of blockchain to Food Industries to benefit from the supply chain transparency and increased supplier and consumer satisfaction. As each stakeholder in the system is helping to improve the system with their data feed contribuitions, they will be rewarded with the percentage of XDC tokens by integrating with Plug-in platform. The following are possible list of stake holders:
Famers
